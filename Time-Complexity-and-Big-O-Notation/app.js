// if algorithm is running in linear time then it's time complexity is O(n), if running in constant time then it's time complexity is O(1)
// Simple operations like addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, and variable assignment take O(1) time.
// Accessing an element in an array or value in hashMap(object) 0(1).
// A single loop iterating n times contributes O(n)

// Nested loops
 
// Two nested loops each running n times, O(n*n)=O(n^2):

// if the loop decreases the range in each iteration(halves the range), it has O(logn) complexity,
